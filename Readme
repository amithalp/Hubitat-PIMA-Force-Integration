PIMA Force – Hubitat Integration

A complete integration of PIMA Force alarm panels with Hubitat Elevation, built around a reliable Node-RED → Hubitat bridge. This integration provides real-time events, accurate device representation, and full control of your alarm system directly from Hubitat.

What This Integration Provides

Real-Time Alarm System Visibility

Instant zone events: open, closed, tamper, alarm

All partition states: ready, not ready, exit delay, entry delay, armed home/away, alarm

Panel-wide events: troubles, heartbeat, connectivity

Sirens represented as actual on/off switch devices

Direct Control from Hubitat

Arm Home / Arm Away

Disarm

Activate or deactivate sirens

Read partition delays (exit/entry)

Query and refresh panel configuration

Clean Hubitat Device Structure

The integration creates:

Device Type

Purpose

PIMA Force Alarm Panel (parent device)

Main controller and state aggregator

Partition devices

Arm/disarm + all partition status

Zone devices

Real-time open/close + alarm + tamper

Siren devices

Pure ON/OFF (correct mapping for PIMA hardware)

All children are created automatically when the system receives initial data from Node-RED.

Rock-Solid Communication Layer

Using Node-RED guarantees:

Stable TCP session with the PIMA panel

Automatic reconnect

Full PIMA protocol parsing (EVENT + OPERATION + DATA-REQ)

Fallbacks and safety logic

Clean Maker API communication to Hubitat

Requirements

Before starting:

You must have the installer password for your PIMA Force system.

Your PIMA Force panel must run the JSON-enabled firmware (contact PIMA support to update it).

Hardware

PIMA Force alarm panel with LAN module

A server running Node-RED (Raspberry Pi, Proxmox VM, etc.)

Software

Hubitat Maker API (built-in)

Node-RED 3.x or later [we need to mention the pallates we are using so the user can instal them]

This repository (drivers + Node-RED flow)

Installation Guide

1. PIMA Force Panel Configuration

Before installing the integration, verify the following on your PIMA panel:

LAN module is installed and enabled

Panel has a static IP address

Installer access is available

JSON firmware is installed

LAN module is reachable from Node-RED

2. Install Hubitat Drivers

Install the following files from /drivers/:

PIMA Force Alarm Panel (parent)

PIMA Force Partition (child)

PIMA Force Zone (child)

PIMA Force Siren (child)

You should install these manually as I am not uploading to HPM for now.

3. Create the Hubitat Parent Device

Go to Devices → Add Virtual Device

Name it (e.g., PIMA Force Alarm Panel)

Select driver: PIMA Force Alarm Panel

Save device

The child devices will be created later automatically.

4. Configure Maker API

Add a new Maker API instance

Allow control of the parent device

Copy:

Maker API App ID

Maker API Access Token

Maker API Base URL

Paste them into the parent driver preferences.

5. Install the Node-RED Flow (Mandatory)

Import the JSON flow from /node-red/pima-flow.json.

This flow includes:

A persistent TCP connection to the PIMA LAN module

Full PIMA protocol parsing (EVENT / OPERATION / DATA-REQ)

Automatic reconnect and connection health monitoring

Bridge-state and heartbeat reporting

Automatic Maker API communication to Hubitat

Test inject nodes for troubleshooting

Required Node-RED Palettes

Before deploying the flow, install these palettes:

node-red-contrib-buffer-parser (protocol decoding)

node-red-contrib-hubitat (Maker API integration)

node-red-dashboard (optional)

node-red-contrib-moment (optional)

What You Must Configure in Node-RED

The flow receives its configuration directly from Hubitat using the syncConfig command. You do not need to manually enter Maker API URLs or PIMA credentials in Node-RED.

You must verify only:

The TCP node points to the correct PIMA panel IP and port

The Hubitat nodes belong to the Hubitat palette (installed above)

After deploying the flow, it connects to the panel automatically and begins sending frames to Hubitat.

Make sure the node-red-contrib-hubitat palette is installed so the flow can communicate with Hubitat.

6. Initial Sync

As soon as the PIMA panel sends DATA-REQ information:

All partitions are created

All zones are created with correct labels

All sirens/outputs are created

The panel state becomes active

You now see real-time events inside Hubitat.

Using the Integration

Arm / Disarm

On a Partition device:

armHome

armAway

disarm

Zone Activity

Each zone device updates:

open / closed

alarm events

tamper

lastEventTs

Siren Control

Each siren acts as an ON/OFF switch.

Presence / Connectivity

The parent device reports:

bridgeState

heartbeatTs

If the PIMA panel becomes unreachable, the device shows not present.

What You Must Configure

In Hubitat:

Install all 4 drivers

Create one parent device

Set MakerAPI URL + token in the parent device

Save preferences

In Node-RED:

You do not need to manually configure credentials or MakerAPI URLs. Hubitat sends all required settings to Node-RED via the syncConfig command.

You only need to verify:

The TCP node points to the correct PIMA LAN IP + port

The Hubitat palette is installed (node-red-contrib-hubitat)

Deploy the flow

In your LAN:

Ensure PIMA LAN module has a static IP

Ensure Node-RED can reach Hubitat and PIMA

How It Works

[PIMA Panel]  ←TCP→  [Node-RED Parser]  → MakerAPI →  [Hubitat Parent Device]
                                                       ↓ auto-creates
                                             [Partitions] [Zones] [Sirens]

Updates & Maintenance

Updating Node-RED Flow

Re-import the JSON file or update only the changed nodes.

Updating Hubitat Drivers

Replace the drivers and click Save.

PIMA Firmware

Some users may need a manual firmware update from PIMA support.

Troubleshooting

No child devices appear

Confirm MakerAPI settings

Trigger manual syncConfig in Node-RED

Check Node-RED logs for TCP failures

Wrong timestamps

Ensure Node-RED and Hubitat time settings are correct.

Event delay

PIMA panels send events with a built-in ~1 second minimum interval.
